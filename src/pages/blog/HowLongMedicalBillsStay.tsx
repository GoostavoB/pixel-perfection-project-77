                  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                    An unpaid medical bill in collections can stay on your credit report for up to <strong>7 years from the date you first became delinquent</strong> (missed the payment to the original provider). This timeline is set by federal law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) for most negative credit items.

            <p>
              The clock starts from the <strong>original delinquency date</strong> – and importantly, paying the debt does not reset the 7-year clock. However, under current policies, if you pay the medical collection, it should be removed from your report within 1-2 months rather than waiting the full 7 years.

            <p>

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  On your credit report, yes – after 7 years it will disappear from your credit history even if unpaid. Legally, the debt might still exist, but most states have statutes of limitations (4-6 years) after which collectors can't sue you. After 7 years, your credit won't be affected.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  It could be a timing issue or oversight. The removal policy began mid-2022. Allow 1-2 months after payment for the update. If it's been longer, dispute it with the credit bureaus, providing proof of payment. Include the reason: "paid medical collection – should be removed per July 2022 credit bureau policy."

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Each collection has its own 7-year timeline based on when that debt went delinquent. If you had multiple bills from different dates, they'll have different drop-off dates. Track the "Date of First Delinquency" for each to know when they'll fall off.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Some agencies might not report if you enter a payment plan and stick to it – ask when setting it up. If already reported, they usually won't remove until fully paid. Once paid off, it should be removed within 1-2 months.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  No, they follow the same 7-year rule. In fact, they often affect credit for a shorter duration thanks to new removal policies and grace periods. Medical bills are increasingly treated more leniently than credit card or loan delinquencies.

            <p>
              An unpaid medical bill can stay on your credit report for up to seven years, but you have more power than ever to shorten that timeline significantly:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
              <li><strong>Know your dates:</strong> Identify when each debt became delinquent to mark the 7-year removal point</li>
              <li><strong>Use new policies:</strong> Pay off collections to clear them quickly from your report</li>
              <li><strong>Review reports regularly:</strong> Ensure old debts are removed when they should be</li>
              <li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help:</strong> Hospitals and collectors can be cooperative if you communicate</li>
