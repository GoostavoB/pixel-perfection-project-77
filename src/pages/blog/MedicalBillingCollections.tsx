            <p>
              When you don't pay a medical bill, healthcare providers make several attempts to collect payment themselves. After a certain point (often a few months), unpaid medical bills may be "sent to collections." Here's the complete process:

                      After 90-180 days of non-payment, the provider assigns or sells your debt to a third-party collection agency. About 58% of all debt collection tradelines on credit reports are from medical debts.

                <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Can a medical debt collector sue me?</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Yes, if the debt is significant and you're unresponsive, they might sue. If they win, they could garnish wages or place liens. However, each state has a statute of limitations (often 3-6 years) for how long they can legally sue. Nonprofit hospitals that follow IRS rules cannot sue until 120 days after no payment and after determining you don't qualify for financial assistance.

                <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Should I pay a medical debt in collections?</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Only if it's truly yours and accurate. First, verify the debt is legitimate and request an itemized bill. If valid and you can afford it, paying removes it from your credit report within 1-2 months under current policies. If you can't afford the full amount, negotiate a settlement. If there are errors, dispute it instead of paying.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  If you request debt validation and they cannot provide sufficient proof (like an itemized bill from the original provider), they must stop collection efforts. You can then dispute it with credit bureaus, and if unverifiable, it must be removed from your credit report.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Yes! If your care was at a nonprofit hospital, you can still apply for charity care even after the debt went to collections. If you qualify (often up to 200-400% of federal poverty level), the debt could be forgiven or significantly reduced. Collection agencies handling debt for nonprofit hospitals must inform you about financial assistance availability.

                    Medical debt in collections is a business process, not a reflection of your character. By understanding the system and asserting your rights, you can often resolve the debt for less than owed and protect your credit in the process.
