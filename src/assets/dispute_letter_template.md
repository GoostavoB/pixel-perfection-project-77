Dear Billing Department,

I am writing to formally dispute charges on the above-referenced medical bill. After careful review of the itemized statement, I have identified significant billing errors and potential violations of federal law that require immediate correction.

---

## ISSUE 1: NO SURPRISES ACT VIOLATIONS

**[INCLUDE THIS SECTION ONLY IF NSA APPLIES]**

This bill involves **[emergency care / out-of-network clinician services at an in-network facility / air ambulance services]**, which is protected under the **No Surprises Act** (45 CFR ยง 149.410).

**Federal Law Protections:**
Under the No Surprises Act (effective January 1, 2022), I am only responsible for in-network cost-sharing amounts for the following scenarios:
- Emergency services at any facility (in-network or out-of-network)
- Non-emergency services by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities
- Air ambulance services

**Balance Billing Violations:**
The following charges constitute illegal balance billing under federal law:

| Line Item | CPT Code | Provider | Charged Amount | Issue |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| [DESCRIPTION] | [CPT_CODE] | [OON_PROVIDER] | $[AMOUNT] | Out-of-network [anesthesiologist/radiologist/pathologist/ER physician] at in-network facility |
| [DESCRIPTION] | [CPT_CODE] | [OON_PROVIDER] | $[AMOUNT] | Emergency service balance bill |

**Total Illegal Balance Billing:** $[TOTAL_NSA_AMOUNT]

**REQUESTED ACTION:**
1. Rebill all NSA-protected services at in-network allowed amounts
2. My patient responsibility should not exceed the in-network cost-sharing specified in my insurance plan
3. Remove all balance billing charges totaling $[AMOUNT]
4. Provide confirmation that my credit will not be affected by these illegal charges

**LEGAL CITATION:** 
- 45 CFR ยง 149.410 - Requirements related to balance billing
- Public Law 116-260, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Division BB, Title I

**COMPLAINT NOTICE:**
I am prepared to file a formal complaint with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at **cms.gov/nosurprises** within the 120-day filing window if this matter is not resolved promptly.

## ISSUE 2: CODING & BILLING ERRORS

**[INCLUDE RELEVANT SECTIONS BELOW]**

### A. DUPLICATE CHARGES

The following charges appear multiple times for the same service on the same date, which constitutes duplicate billing:

| CPT Code | Description | Date/Time | # of Times Billed | Amount Each | Total Duplicate |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| [CPT_CODE] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DATE] | [COUNT] | $[AMOUNT] | $[TOTAL] |

**Context:** Duplicate billing is the #1 most common medical billing error, found in 30-40% of audited hospital bills.

**REQUESTED ACTION:** Remove all duplicate charges. Retain only one legitimate charge. **Total adjustment: $[DUPLICATE_TOTAL]**

---

### B. UNBUNDLING

The following services were billed separately but should have been billed as a bundled package under standard coding rules (NCCI edits):

| Separate Charges | CPT Codes | Individual Charges | Should Be Bundled As | Bundled Rate |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| [DESCRIPTIONS] | [CPT_CODES] | $[AMOUNT] each | [BUNDLE_CPT] | ~$[BUNDLED_AMOUNT] |

**Context:** Unbundling accounts for 20-25% of billing disputes and artificially inflates costs by billing components that should be packaged together.

**Examples of improper unbundling:**
- Lab panels split into individual tests
- CT/MRI of adjacent anatomical areas without separate clinical indication
- Surgical procedures with components billed separately

**REQUESTED ACTION:** Rebill as appropriate bundled code. **Estimated adjustment: $[UNBUNDLE_ADJUSTMENT]**

---

### C. UPCODING

The following charges appear to be coded at a higher complexity level than documentation supports:

| Service | Billed Code | Billed Level | Documentation Supports | Appropriate Code | Price Difference |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| [SERVICE] | [HIGH_CPT] | Level [X] | Level [Y] | [LOW_CPT] | $[DIFFERENCE] |

**Context:** Upcoding represents 25% of disputed medical claims and involves billing for a more expensive service than what was actually provided.

**Common upcoding examples:**
- Emergency room visit coded as Level 4-5 when documentation supports Level 2-3
- Office visit coded as "complex" when it was routine
- Procedure described as "extensive" when it was limited

**REQUESTED ACTION:** Review medical documentation and rebill with appropriate code. **Estimated adjustment: $[UPCODE_ADJUSTMENT]**

---

### D. SERVICES NOT RENDERED

The following charges appear for services, medications, or supplies that were not documented in my medical records:

| Line Item | CPT/Description | Charged Amount | Issue |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| [ITEM] | [CODE] | $[AMOUNT] | Not documented in discharge papers |
| [ITEM] | [CODE] | $[AMOUNT] | Excessive quantity (e.g., [X] units when [Y] is reasonable) |
| [ITEM] | [CODE] | $[AMOUNT] | Not listed in Medication Administration Record (MAR) |

**Context:** 10-15% of patients discover charges for services they never received when comparing bills to medical records.

**REQUESTED ACTION:** Provide documentation proving these services were rendered, or remove charges. **Total adjustment: $[NOT_RENDERED_TOTAL]**

---

## ISSUE 3: PRICING & TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS

**[INCLUDE IF APPLICABLE]**

### A. FACILITY FEES

A facility fee of **$[FACILITY_FEE_AMOUNT]** (Code: [G0463 or other]) was charged without clear disclosure.

**Context:** Facility fees are the #4 most common source of billing confusion. While sometimes legitimate, they are often poorly disclosed and can double or triple the cost of routine visits.

**REQUESTED ACTION:** 
1. Provide clear justification for why this facility fee was applied
2. Compare charge to your hospital's published price transparency file
3. If this was a routine outpatient visit, explain why a facility fee is appropriate

---

### B. TRAUMA ACTIVATION FEE

A trauma activation fee of **$[TRAUMA_FEE]** was charged.

**Context:** Trauma activation fees (ranking #8 in common complaints) can reach $10,000+ even when the full trauma team was not utilized or extensive trauma care was not provided.

**REQUESTED ACTION:**
1. Provide documentation of trauma team activation criteria
2. Document which team members responded and their role in my care
3. Justify the fee level based on actual resources utilized

---

### C. PRICING OUTLIERS

The following charges significantly exceed reasonable market rates:

| Service | Your Charge | Typical Range* | Variance |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| [SERVICE] | $[YOUR_CHARGE] | $[RANGE_LOW] - $[RANGE_HIGH] | +[PERCENT]% above median |

*Source: [Hospital's own transparency file / Medicare rates / Regional benchmarks]

**REQUESTED ACTION:** Adjust these charges to median contracted rates or provide justification for charges significantly above market standards.

---

## ISSUE 4: PRE-EOB BILLING

**[INCLUDE IF APPLICABLE]**

This statement was issued **before my insurance company processed the claim** (no EOB date or reference number present).

**Context:** Pre-EOB billing is the #7 most common tactic and causes patients to overpay. This statement shows an inflated "patient balance" that does not reflect what I will actually owe after insurance processing.

**REQUESTED ACTION:**
1. Confirm this is a pre-EOB statement, not a final bill
2. Do not send to collections until insurance has processed the claim
3. Issue corrected statement after EOB showing actual patient responsibility

---

## ISSUE 5: IMPROPER COLLECTIONS ACTIVITY

**[INCLUDE ONLY IF BILL IS IN COLLECTIONS]**

This account has been sent to collections **[COLLECTION_AGENCY_NAME]** despite containing disputed and potentially illegal charges.

**CFPB Guidance Violation:**
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued clear guidance that collection activity on invalid, unsubstantiated, or legally prohibited medical debt violates federal consumer protection laws.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. **Suspend all collection activity** on this account immediately
2. **Recall this debt** from the collection agency
3. **Remove any negative reporting** from credit bureaus
4. **Resolve billing errors** outlined in this letter before any collection activity resumes

**NOTICE:** I will file formal complaints with:
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (consumerfinance.gov/complaint)
- State Attorney General's Office
- State Department of Insurance

if collection activity continues on these disputed charges.
